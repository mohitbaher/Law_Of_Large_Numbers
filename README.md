Law_Of_Large_Numbers
    The law of large numbers is a mathematical law that states that the average of all the results obtained from a large number of independent individual random samples. It was earlier stated (without proof) by an Italian mathematician, Gerolamo Cardano, that the statistical accuracy of a sample case tends to improve with the increase in the number of trials conducted on the sample space. It was later formalized as the Law of Large Numbers. 
    Taking a basic example of a fair coin toss. When a fair coin is tossed a large number of times, the proportion of heads will approach the theoretical probability of 0.5 (50%). With the increase in the number of trials, we may observe that the fractions of heads become more stable and tend closer to the expected ideal expected value of 50%.
    On the otherhand if a coin is tossed only a few times, you can witness unbalanced results like the percentage of heads reaching as high as 70%(for example) or as low as 30%(for example). thereby these short term variations may be unfair/insignificant.
